### Graph Algorithms.
Basic Graph Algorithms: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/06-basic-graph-algorithms.pdf
Shortest Path: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/07-shortest-path-algorithms.pdf

In slide 9 of Basic Graph Algorithms, he refers to Solution 3 being the fastest. However, in competitions, Solution 2, using Adjacency List, is usually sufficient.

You will use some data structures for implementing graph algorithms, and this is a useful slide:
http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/03-data-structures.pdf

Focus on the following topics: Depth-First, Breadth-First Search, Special Graph, Topological sort, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Floyd Warshall, and Dijkstra's algorithm.

There are a lot of algorithms here. For now, thoroughly understand what each algorithm does and its time complexity. You can have templates for the contest, so you don't need to memorize the details, although it helps when you understand how these algorithms work.
