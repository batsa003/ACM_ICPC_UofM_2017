# ACM_ICPC_UofM_2017
ACM ICPC Practice Session for University of Minnesota, Fall 2017.

Tips:
1. For each algorithm, first do several google search and pick few of them to understand it in high-level.
2. For each algorithm, know the input, output, and the main idea.
3. In your choice of programming language, write a template for the algorithm (or find one). You don't have to understand some of the complicated algorithms in detail.


We are meeting at Lind 217, every Wednesday from 6:00pm to 7:30pm
