### Dynamic Programming
There is almost always some form of Dynamic Programming problem in every programming competitions.

Good sources to start:
* Introduction to Algorithms, Cormen. (Chapter 16)
* Youtube lectures from MIT (Fibonacci, Shortest Path, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence etc,.)
* http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/04-dynamic-programming.pdf

You should understand the underlying principles (Why it works? What is Optimal Substructure? etc,.).
Also, become comfortable with bottom up, top down, and memoization approaches.

### Greedy Algorithm

It is also good to have an intuition for Greedy algorithms, which also appears from time to time.

Good sources to start:
* Introduction to Algorithms, Cormen. (Chapter 17)
* https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/greedy/basics-of-greedy-algorithms/tutorial/

Build up your intuition for the underlying principles: Greedy choice property and Optimal substructure.

Understanding Dijkstra's algorithm and Minimum Spanning Trees are useful. But we will learn them under Graph algorithms next week.

Make sure you are familiar with the following data structures in your favorite programming language:
* Priority Queue, Set, Stack, and Queue.
